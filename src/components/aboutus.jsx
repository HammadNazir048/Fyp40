            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            To optimize the video editing process, we propose Script Scout, a web application that automates the task of gathering relevant images and content based on a provided script. Video editors currently face a time-consuming and manual process of searching and selecting images and content relevant to their scripts, often relying on stock image websites or manual web searches. This web application addresses these challenges efficiently by reducing the time spent on manual searches and improving the overall productivity of video editors.xisting tools and resources do not effectively bridge the gap between a given script and the identification and retrieval of visually relevant content. Script Scout aims to automate the process of identifying and extracting images and content relevant to a given input and provide a user-friendly interface for video editors to easily upload their scripts and receive a collection of relevant visuals. This application aims to save time and enhance user’s productivity by eliminating the need for manual searches and content curation. Script Scout has the potential to significantly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the video editing process, empowering video editors to create visually engaging and impactful content with greater ease and speed.
